#### My Papa asked to how do I get local newspaper online. 
And this script was created. 

## What does this script do ?
  * This scrits basically dowloads the individual pdf file of the news paper present on the website "http://epaper.jagran.com/homepage.aspx" .
  * It then merges the individual pdfs.
  * After the pdf merging it sends an email with an attachment ( e-paper ) to the email id.

## RUN
  * change the config file
  * 
  * run `python Dainik_e_paper.py`
